# The project was developed using the expo library, so to run it locally you have to open the project, run the comand npm start and the expo panel will open in browser.
# From this point you can either open the app using a mobile phone with the Expo go app, which you can find in the Android or Apple store, or by using an emulator, on which the expo go app, will get installed when you click Run on "Android device/emulator" or "Run on iOS simulator".
# To log in the app, use username : "User" and password: "parola", those are already autocompleted in the login fields.
